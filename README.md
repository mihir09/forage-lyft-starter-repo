# Working on Forage Lyft Backend project

### Ultimate learning experience as a Backend engineer and understanding the flow of Test-driven Development (TDD)

Goal: Car services status should be found using engine, battery, and tire information.

Challenge: Currently defined models are straightforward. To add the tire information and include them in finding service status, classes, and test cases need to be redefined.

## Task 1: Software Architecture (Completed) 
Figure out the project needs and current challenges faced.
Planned and drafted a UML with a new reorganized architecture. This allows the easy addition of new features with minimum changes.

## Task 2: Refactoring existing files (Completed) 
Based on the new UML, classes are updated and changed as needed.

## Task 3: Adding Unittests for engine and battery (Completed)
To ensure the system works correctly, added unit tests for each engine and battery.

## Task 4: Added tire feature and its test cases (Completed)
Updated the system to consider tire information while deciding whether the car needs to be serviced or not.
