# Working on Forage Lyft Backend project

Goal: In addition to battery and engine, car services status should be found out using tire information.

Challenge: Currently defined models are straightforward. To add the tire information and include them in finding service status, classes, and test cases need to be redefined.

## Task 1: Software Architecture (Completed) 
Understood the project needs and current challenges faced.
Planned and drafted a UML with a new reorganized architecture. This allows the easy addition of new features with minimum changes.

## Task 2: Refactoring existing files (Completed) 
Based on the new UML, classes are updated and changed as needed.
